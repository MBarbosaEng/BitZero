- Your system is all installed and ready to go. Life is good when there are no confusing databases or admins to worry about.

Now all you have to do is publish your first post. To do that, just follow these instructions below. Or, if you already know how to use, just publish your first post to delete this message.

## Writing Posts
You can write your posts offline (using the text or Markdown editor of your choice) in Markdown format. Here's a handy [syntax guide](https://github.com/circa75/dropplets/wiki/Markdown-Syntax-Guide) if you need a little help with your Markdown skills. All posts **MUST** be composed using the following format:

    # Your Post Title
    - Post Author Name (e.g. "My Name")
    - Post Author Twitter Handle (e.g. "mytwitter")
    - Publish Date in YYYY/MM/DD Format (e.g. "2013/04/28")
    - Post Category (e.g. "Random Thoughts")
    - Post Status (e.g. "published" or "draft")
    - Tag your post use a comma as delimiter (e.g. "development,git,workflow")
	- Brief description of the post.

	Your post text starts here.

#### Note
When Twitter’s author is informed on the post, this will be used as an avatar. If not entered, the search will be done automatically by the avatar.

If Twitter author is given, will be inserted link to Twitter’s website.

#### Images

All posts must also be saved with the **.md** file extension. For instance, if your post title is **My First Blog Post**, your post file should look like this:

    my-first-blog-post.md

Some templates include the ability to add a post image or thumbnail along with your post in which should match your post file name like this:

>	my-first-blog-post.jpg
>	
>	or
>	
>	my-first-blog-post.png

    
Post file names are used to structure post permalinks on your blog. So, a post file saved as **my-first-blog-post.md** will result in **yoursite.com/my-first-blog-post** as the post permalink.

## Publishing Posts
After you've finished writing your post offline, you can then publish your post using the Dropplets toolbar:

1. Login to your installation using the password you created during the installation and setup process.
2. Click the Dropplet in your toolbar to select, upload and publish your post.

## Editing Posts
Re-upload your edited post file using the steps above. Doing this will automatically overwrite the existing post and publish your new edits. To delete a post, change the **Post Status** at the top of your post file to **draft**.
