## Last Versions

### <a name="Version-1.05"></a>Version 1.05 - Published: Jan 25, 2014

- Improving the way to show categories 
- Separated into individual files of the code index.php file for easier maintenance. 
- Page demos versioned.

### <a name="Version-1.04"></a>Version 1.04 - Published: Jan 25, 2014

This version has been deployed all existing Pull Requests until the present time. 
This allows for better compatibility with Dropplets. 


## Important notice: 

We must remember that it is not mandatory application of these requests and that many may be obsolete or have already been implemented by the BitZero system itself. 

There are features that are in development and therefore may conflict with a specific request. So they can not be present at the time but likely to be deployed in the future. 

If you have an idea but do not know how to program, share with us so we can develop it for you.
