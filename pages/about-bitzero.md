## Dropplets

Dropplets is a minimalist **Markdown** blogging platform focused on delivering just what you need in a blogging solution, but absolutely nothing you don't. When it comes to basic blogging, all you really want to do is write & publish which is where Dropplets excels. It's databaseless, so it installs on any server in just about 30 seconds. 

## What's Markdown?
Markdown is a text formatting syntax inspired on plain text email. It is extremely simple, memorizable and visually lightweight on artifacts so as not to hinder reading.

> The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
